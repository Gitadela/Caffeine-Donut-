##  Introduction ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ

Hi! everyone! I’m **Adela** — a girl who’s been away from school for a while. After a long break (don’t ask how long, lol), I figured it’s time to get back on track. So here I am, revisiting programming by joining the *Code in Practice* course from Stanford.

This game? It’s kind of my way of processing all that. It’s weird. It’s full of bugs (some on purpose). And yes, it’s kinda me, trying to debug life one Python puzzle at a time.

## What’s This Game About? ▶• ılıılıılılııılıılı. 0

- A little puzzle-adventure about coding, confusion, and caffeine.
- Python-themed rooms with actual programming logic challenges.
- No combat. No boss fights. Just you, code, and the creeping sense you forgot everything from school.

---

##  What's the Point?

- Brush up on Python stuff: loops, lists, conditions, functions, etc.
- Think like a programmer again (or for the first time).
- And mostly… survive. (((ﾟдﾟ)))

## Rooms (a.k.a. Adela’s brain compartments) ٩(๑•̀ω•́๑)۶

* **Room 1**–**Room 7**: Each with its own Python puzzle—some tricky, some dumb, all mine.
* **Room 8**: The final room. Not epic. Just... done.

## 👀 Notes from Me

* I built this while trying to remember how anything in Python works.
* I was supposed to extend it a bit more... but honestly I’m burned out lately and haven’t had time, LOL. Maybe someday.
* If anything breaks… well, it’s probably my fault, and I accept that.

## 💬 Hey, One More Thing

Don’t give up on yourself.
Seriously. Don’t let your age or where you’re at stop you.
If you’re going through your downtime like me (haha… unemployed yeah!) — just know you *can* get through it.

This game was a way for me to not feel completely useless. So if you're in a weird space too: hey, you’re not alone. Debug life at your own pace.

## 📜 License

MIT. Go ahead and use it, break it, improve it. Just shout me out if it ends up on a billboard or something.

## ☕ Thanks

Thanks to the Stanford Code in Practice course for being the kick I needed.
And to you — yeah you — for even reading this far.

See you in the next `while dream = True:` loop.
